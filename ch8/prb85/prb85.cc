//Reimplement gen_sentence and xref functions from chapter 7 to use output iterators rather than putting their entire outpu in one data structure. 
//Test these new versions by writing programs that attach the output iterator directly to the standard output, and by storing the results in:
//
//list<string> and 
//map<string, vector<int> >
