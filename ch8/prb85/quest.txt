Reimplement the gen_sentence and xref functions to use output iterators 
rather than putting their entire output in one data structure. Test these 
new versions by writing programs that attach the output iterator directly to
the standard output, and by storing the results in a 
list<string> and a map<string, vector<int> >, respectively.
