everytime that i look in the mirror,
all these lines on my face getting clearer,
the past is gone,
It went by like dusk to dawn,
Isn't that the ways,
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay,
#######
Yeah, I know nobody knows,
Where it comes and where it goes,
I know it's everybody's sin,
You got to lose to know how to win,
