Implement the swap function that we used in 8.2.5(148). (reverse implemenation)
Why did we call swap rather than exchange the values of *beg and *end directly


Ans --> 

beg and end "point" to the elements in the vector. 
We want to exchange the values that they "point to". To do this, we have 
to dereference the iterators and exchange them. 
This is done in "incorrect_swap_function.cc". It is easier to use swap function.
